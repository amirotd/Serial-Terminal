# Serial-Terminal
 This repository contains a very simple data terminal for devices that use **RS232** or any kind of **Serial-UART interface** connected with a USB to serial converter.<br>
 The purpose of this project is to be a light *cross-platform* data terminal for simple **IoT** devices with **Serial-UART interface**, to display and **plot** the data that they get from sensors like Temperature sensors, Ultrasonic sensors, etc.<br>
 For simple data communication, this project uses a **graphical user interface** (**Tkinter** for python version and **Qt** for C++ version).

### Features
- a graphical user interface (GUI) for simple data communication
- plotting data on graph using pyqtgraph (for now this feature is only for python version)

### Credits
 The project uses the [pyserial](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial) library.<br>
 also it uses Qt 6.2.1
