# Serial-Terminal
 This repository contains a very simple *python* based data terminal for devices that use **RS232** or any kind of **Serial-UART interface** connected with a USB to serial converter.<br>
 The purpose of this project is to be a light *cross-platform* data terminal for simple **IoT** devices with **Serial-UART interface**, to display and **plot** the data that they get from sensors like Temperature sensors, Ultrasonic sensors, etc.<br>
 For simple data communication, this project uses a **GUI** which is made by the **python Tkinter library**.

### Features
- a graphical user interface (GUI) for simple data communication
- plotting data on graph using pyqtgraph

### Credits
 The project uses the [pyserial](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial) library.
